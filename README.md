# Predictive function optimization

This project contains some optimization methods applied for predictive functions based on machine learning, the optimization methods are based in metaheuristics and have different approaches which define their performance. The main objective is to develop a routine that can be used in the future for new datasets. This proceeding is applied for datasets that contain variables with different scales and the response variable is numerical.

The data used comes from a platform known as BEM (Spanish acronym for MASAGRO Electronic Field book)
